Dear Amento Hannah,
I wanted to take a moment to thank the recruitment team for meeting with me last week to discuss the roles at Vi-Jon. I enjoyed learning more about the company and the opportunity, and I appreciate the time you took to interview me.
I am very interested in the position, and I was wondering if you had any feedback on my performance during the interview. Specifically, I would be interested in hearing about my strengths and areas where I could improve.
I am open to any constructive criticism you may have and would be grateful for any advice you can offer. Thank you again for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
Best regards,
Christopher Ewuola


Thank you for the update. The OPT is a work authorization for international student and it is usually for a year and renewable for another two years. However, as stated in my earlier email response, I and in the advance process of getting my permanent residence/work authorization hence the company will not be burdened  with my wok authorization  procees.
